DANIEL MORGAN, SENIOR PORTFOLIO MANAGER, SYNOVUS TRUST COMPANY, ATLANTA, GEORGIA: \\u201cThere\\u2019s a bit of a relief rally. There were worries going into it... but it\\u2019s a mixed bag. \\u201cIt does now open the door for maybe they table the whole thing and just move on, and I would think the next thing on the docket would have to be tax reform. The market, to me, is more interested in tax reform than it is in changing Obamacare. \\u201cIn a way, for me, sitting on $600 million worth of investments, I think it\\u2019s great. Let\\u2019s move and get into tax reform, and then get into the infrastructure bill.\\u201d PETER JANKOVSKIS, CO-CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, OAKBROOK INVESTMENTS LLC, LISLE, ILLINOIS: \\u201cThe market is relieved it\\u2019s not going to go down to a defeat, and it\\u2019s hopeful they\\u2019ll come to some sort of agreement over the weekend. The market is hoping for an agreement as a stepping stone to additional agreements.\\u201d \\u201cNews report suggested that the likely outcome was they were going to lose. I would think the expectations are that they\\u2019re pulling it so they can work on it.\\u201d \\u201cThe last few days, market has sort of traded on the back foot on anticipation of the vote that would happen at some point this week. Generally, risk sentiment has been undermined off of that, especially with this steady drip of news that indicated lacking support for the bill. And now, I think, it sort of lifted that uncertainty, at least temporarily, for the rest of the day. Maybe just lifting the uncertainty premium has markets breathing a sigh of relief for now.\\u201d PARESH UPADHYAYA, DIRECTOR OF CURRENCY STRATEGY, PIONEER INVESTMENTS, BOSTON: \\u201cThe initial market interpretation is a positive sign. It seems like it is taking that Trump wants to instead of sinking it, he wants to give it another shot. It seems like they think he is working to get something on his agenda to be passed by Congress. Or perhaps it\\u2019s a sign that if healthcare reform is shelved, Trump will focus on tax reform. It\\u2019s more a knee jerk reaction.  \\u201cThere are still a lot of hard questions regardless to tax reform. He can\\u2019t force people to change their vote on social media. Good old fashion politicking is needed to build consensus.  \\u201cIf this stronger dollar has legs, it depends on the next step. If there is a pivot to taxes from healthcare, the market has to see the plan.\\u201d RAHUL SHAH, CHIEF EXECUTIVE, IDEAL ASSET MANAGEMENT, NEW YORK: \\u201cFrom an investor viewpoint, it shows that Trump will not be able to easily pass his agenda. That being said, healthcare is more difficult to pass than tax cuts and the infrastructure bill that he\\u2019s proposing. \\u201cIn one sense that\\u2019s a negative, but on the other hand it also might give some relief to investors who are concerned about some of Trump\\u2019s more controversial proposals like increased tariffs and a border adjustment tax.  \\u201cYou could see this as a glass half empty or a glass half-full, gridlock is not something that\\u2019s unheard of on Wall Street, so I think stocks should be OK going forward.\\u201d \\u201cI think the most important thing is that this changes the perception of the relationship between Trump and Congress. For the last few months the assumption has been that Congress would do whatever the Trump plan called for, and that apparently is not going to be the case.\\u201d PETER KENNY, SENIOR MARKET STRATEGIST, GLOBAL MARKETS ADVISORY GROUP, NEW YORK: \\u201cI don\\u2019t think it\\u2019s going to have a huge impact on equities, although it may have more of an impact on biotech and healthcare.  \\u201cThis is now an indication that the president\\u2019s agenda is probably going to be more ambitious than Congress can manage. It is probably going to mean that equity markets are going to have to factor in a degree of dysfunction that investors were hoping they wouldn\\u2019t have to. Which means it will likely have a muted impact on equity performance moving forward.  \\u201cThere is very little on the horizon as of right now, as a result of this thing being pulled, that is going to fuel a significant move higher in prices. This is largely going to homogenize any sort of volatility moving forward and is probably going to be a cap on any near-term performance in terms of the upside. \\u201cThe fact this bill, which the President has said flat-out he will make it work for all Americans in general, can\\u2019t pass is an indication this agenda is going to be more ambitious than this Congress can work with. This doesn\\u2019t even include the Democrats.\\u00a0It is not just divided between Democrats and Republicans, it is divided between progressives, Democrats, Republicans and Libertarians. It is an indication that investors should not expect the kind of velocity in terms of agenda accomplishments they were expecting when he was elected.\\u201d MARGARET PATEL, SENIOR PORTFOLIO MANAGER, WELLS FARGO ASSET MANAGEMENT, BOSTON: \\u201cIt looked like the market was worried that the Trump agenda would get completely bogged down in the healthcare issue, and now that they\\u2019ve taken the healthcare issue off the table, I think the market is more optimistic that they can do other things that are more doable that are not so complicated, such as regulatory reform and lowering taxes. It does seem like a positive move to shelve an issue that\\u2019s so complex and very expensive no matter what the plan, move on to something that is a little bit easier, which would be lowering taxes.\\u201d BRIAN BATTLE, DIRECTOR OF TRADING, PERFORMANCE TRUST CAPITAL PARTNERS, CHICAGO: \\u201cIt didn\\u2019t pass and it didn\\u2019t fail so any conjecture about the ultimate meaning is premature. President Trump is getting a lesson in varsity Washington politics.\\u201d STOCKS: S&P 500 pares losses to end session down fractionally; Dow ends down 0.29 percent; Nasdaq ends up 0.19 percent BONDS: 2- and 10-year Treasury yields rise from session lows FOREX: The dollar index edges up by gains against the euro and yen \",\n          \" The \\u2018Fake Melania Trump\\u2019 Conspiracy Theory Is Taking The Internet By Storm And It\\u2019s Everything The Internet is going crazy after photos, videos and .gifs have been circulated of Melania Trump with her husband at a press conference on Monday. Will the real Melania Trump please stand up? Don t look at me like that.

Blink twice next time you re on the air if you need help, girlfriend. We might be there for you. Maybe.It all started with this tweet from social media user @JoeVargas, then it went viral.

Trump supporters seem upset on Twitter that Melania is trending on the social site over this conspiracy theory, but the ones their president circulated are OK by them. Also, what happened to Melania Trump s nose? There s something funny going on there. And why isn t Alex Jones all over this? Hmm maybe he s a part of it. I mean, if NASA had to step forward to deny that it is running a child sex slave ring on Mars because of Jones s conspiracy theory then we can ask what part he played in switching a body double for the First Lady.

DANIEL MORGAN, SENIOR PORTFOLIO MANAGER, SYNOVUS TRUST COMPANY, ATLANTA, GEORGIA: \\u201cThere\\u2019s a bit of a relief rally. There were worries going into it... but it\\u2019s a mixed bag. \\u201cIt does now open the door for maybe they table the whole thing and just move on, and I would think the next thing on the docket would have to be tax reform. The market, to me, is more interested in tax reform than it is in changing Obamacare. \\u201cIn a way, for me, sitting on $600 million worth of investments, I think it\\u2019s great. Let\\u2019s move and get into tax reform, and then get into the infrastructure bill.\\u201d PETER JANKOVSKIS, CO-CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, OAKBROOK INVESTMENTS LLC, LISLE, ILLINOIS: \\u201cThe market is relieved it\\u2019s not going to go down to a defeat, and it\\u2019s hopeful they\\u2019ll come to some sort of agreement over the weekend. The market is hoping for an agreement as a stepping stone to additional agreements.\\u201d \\u201cNews report suggested that the likely outcome was they were going to lose. I would think the expectations are that they\\u2019re pulling it so they can work on it.\\u201d \\u201cThe last few days, market has sort of traded on the back foot on anticipation of the vote that would happen at some point this week. Generally, risk sentiment has been undermined off of that, especially with this steady drip of news that indicated lacking support for the bill. And now, I think, it sort of lifted that uncertainty, at least temporarily, for the rest of the day. Maybe just lifting the uncertainty premium has markets breathing a sigh of relief for now.\\u201d PARESH UPADHYAYA, DIRECTOR OF CURRENCY STRATEGY, PIONEER INVESTMENTS, BOSTON: \\u201cThe initial market interpretation is a positive sign. It seems like it is taking that Trump wants to instead of sinking it, he wants to give it another shot. It seems like they think he is working to get something on his agenda to be passed by Congress. Or perhaps it\\u2019s a sign that if healthcare reform is shelved, Trump will focus on tax reform. It\\u2019s more a knee jerk reaction.  \\u201cThere are still a lot of hard questions regardless to tax reform. He can\\u2019t force people to change their vote on social media. Good old fashion politicking is needed to build consensus.  \\u201cIf this stronger dollar has legs, it depends on the next step. If there is a pivot to taxes from healthcare, the market has to see the plan.\\u201d RAHUL SHAH, CHIEF EXECUTIVE, IDEAL ASSET MANAGEMENT, NEW YORK: \\u201cFrom an investor viewpoint, it shows that Trump will not be able to easily pass his agenda. That being said, healthcare is more difficult to pass than tax cuts and the infrastructure bill that he\\u2019s proposing. \\u201cIn one sense that\\u2019s a negative, but on the other hand it also might give some relief to investors who are concerned about some of Trump\\u2019s more controversial proposals like increased tariffs and a border adjustment tax.  \\u201cYou could see this as a glass half empty or a glass half-full, gridlock is not something that\\u2019s unheard of on Wall Street, so I think stocks should be OK going forward.\\u201d \\u201cI think the most important thing is that this changes the perception of the relationship between Trump and Congress. For the last few months the assumption has been that Congress would do whatever the Trump plan called for, and that apparently is not going to be the case.\\u201d PETER KENNY, SENIOR MARKET STRATEGIST, GLOBAL MARKETS ADVISORY GROUP, NEW YORK: \\u201cI don\\u2019t think it\\u2019s going to have a huge impact on equities, although it may have more of an impact on biotech and healthcare.  \\u201cThis is now an indication that the president\\u2019s agenda is probably going to be more ambitious than Congress can manage. It is probably going to mean that equity markets are going to have to factor in a degree of dysfunction that investors were hoping they wouldn\\u2019t have to. Which means it will likely have a muted impact on equity performance moving forward.  \\u201cThere is very little on the horizon as of right now, as a result of this thing being pulled, that is going to fuel a significant move higher in prices. This is largely going to homogenize any sort of volatility moving forward and is probably going to be a cap on any near-term performance in terms of the upside. \\u201cThe fact this bill, which the President has said flat-out he will make it work for all Americans in general, can\\u2019t pass is an indication this agenda is going to be more ambitious than this Congress can work with. This doesn\\u2019t even include the Democrats.\\u00a0It is not just divided between Democrats and Republicans, it is divided between progressives, Democrats, Republicans and Libertarians. It is an indication that investors should not expect the kind of velocity in terms of agenda accomplishments they were expecting when he was elected.\\u201d MARGARET PATEL, SENIOR PORTFOLIO MANAGER, WELLS FARGO ASSET MANAGEMENT, BOSTON: \\u201cIt looked like the market was worried that the Trump agenda would get completely bogged down in the healthcare issue, and now that they\\u2019ve taken the healthcare issue off the table, I think the market is more optimistic that they can do other things that are more doable that are not so complicated, such as regulatory reform and lowering taxes. It does seem like a positive move to shelve an issue that\\u2019s so complex and very expensive no matter what the plan, move on to something that is a little bit easier, which would be lowering taxes.\\u201d BRIAN BATTLE, DIRECTOR OF TRADING, PERFORMANCE TRUST CAPITAL PARTNERS, CHICAGO: \\u201cIt didn\\u2019t pass and it didn\\u2019t fail so any conjecture about the ultimate meaning is premature. President Trump is getting a lesson in varsity Washington politics.\\u201d STOCKS: S&P 500 pares losses to end session down fractionally; Dow ends down 0.29 percent; Nasdaq ends up 0.19 percent BONDS: 2- and 10-year Treasury yields rise from session lows FOREX: The dollar index edges up by gains against the euro and yen \",\n          \" The \\u2018Fake Melania Trump\\u2019 Conspiracy Theory Is Taking The Internet By Storm And It\\u2019s Everything The Internet is going crazy after photos, videos and .gifs have been circulated of Melania Trump with her husband at a press conference on Monday.

Trump circulated conspiracy theories about our country s first black president in order to delegitimize his presidency so this is fair game and also, it s hilarious.And if this is not Melania, we have to ask, what has he done with his wife? Blink twice next time you re on the air if you need help, girlfriend. We might be there for you. Maybe.It all started with this tweet from social media user @JoeVargas, then it went viral.

That literally ain t her. https://t.co/9NNpZzy4CK  Sir James The Second (@JKH2) October 18, 2017Donald Trump is a conspiracy theorist who was elevated to power by his gullible base. Trump supporters seem upset on Twitter that Melania is trending on the social site over this conspiracy theory, but the ones their president circulated are OK by them. Also, what happened to Melania Trump s nose? There s something funny going on there. And why isn t Alex Jones all over this? Hmm maybe he s a part of it. I mean, if NASA had to step forward to deny that it is running a child sex slave ring on Mars because of Jones s conspiracy theory then we can ask what part he played in switching a body double for the First Lady. Jones and Trump are buddies, after all. WHAT HAVE Y ALL DONE WITH MELANIA?Stop looking at me like that.Featured image via video screen capture \",\n          \"Top House Democrat Pelosi says independent Russia probe still needed WASHINGTON (Reuters) - House of Representatives Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi welcomed the appointment of a special counsel in the Russia probe involving President Donald Trump but said on Thursday an independent commission was still needed to guard against political pressure from the White House.

DANIEL MORGAN, SENIOR PORTFOLIO MANAGER, SYNOVUS TRUST COMPANY, ATLANTA, GEORGIA: \\u201cThere\\u2019s a bit of a relief rally. There were worries going into it... but it\\u2019s a mixed bag. \\u201cIt does now open the door for maybe they table the whole thing and just move on, and I would think the next thing on the docket would have to be tax reform. The market, to me, is more interested in tax reform than it is in changing Obamacare. \\u201cIn a way, for me, sitting on $600 million worth of investments, I think it\\u2019s great. Let\\u2019s move and get into tax reform, and then get into the infrastructure bill.\\u201d PETER JANKOVSKIS, CO-CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, OAKBROOK INVESTMENTS LLC, LISLE, ILLINOIS: \\u201cThe market is relieved it\\u2019s not going to go down to a defeat, and it\\u2019s hopeful they\\u2019ll come to some sort of agreement over the weekend. The market is hoping for an agreement as a stepping stone to additional agreements.\\u201d \\u201cNews report suggested that the likely outcome was they were going to lose. I would think the expectations are that they\\u2019re pulling it so they can work on it.\\u201d \\u201cThe last few days, market has sort of traded on the back foot on anticipation of the vote that would happen at some point this week. Generally, risk sentiment has been undermined off of that, especially with this steady drip of news that indicated lacking support for the bill. And now, I think, it sort of lifted that uncertainty, at least temporarily, for the rest of the day. Maybe just lifting the uncertainty premium has markets breathing a sigh of relief for now.\\u201d PARESH UPADHYAYA, DIRECTOR OF CURRENCY STRATEGY, PIONEER INVESTMENTS, BOSTON: \\u201cThe initial market interpretation is a positive sign. It seems like it is taking that Trump wants to instead of sinking it, he wants to give it another shot. It seems like they think he is working to get something on his agenda to be passed by Congress. Or perhaps it\\u2019s a sign that if healthcare reform is shelved, Trump will focus on tax reform. It\\u2019s more a knee jerk reaction.  \\u201cThere are still a lot of hard questions regardless to tax reform. He can\\u2019t force people to change their vote on social media. Good old fashion politicking is needed to build consensus.  \\u201cIf this stronger dollar has legs, it depends on the next step. If there is a pivot to taxes from healthcare, the market has to see the plan.\\u201d RAHUL SHAH, CHIEF EXECUTIVE, IDEAL ASSET MANAGEMENT, NEW YORK: \\u201cFrom an investor viewpoint, it shows that Trump will not be able to easily pass his agenda. That being said, healthcare is more difficult to pass than tax cuts and the infrastructure bill that he\\u2019s proposing. \\u201cIn one sense that\\u2019s a negative, but on the other hand it also might give some relief to investors who are concerned about some of Trump\\u2019s more controversial proposals like increased tariffs and a border adjustment tax.  \\u201cYou could see this as a glass half empty or a glass half-full, gridlock is not something that\\u2019s unheard of on Wall Street, so I think stocks should be OK going forward.\\u201d \\u201cI think the most important thing is that this changes the perception of the relationship between Trump and Congress. For the last few months the assumption has been that Congress would do whatever the Trump plan called for, and that apparently is not going to be the case.\\u201d PETER KENNY, SENIOR MARKET STRATEGIST, GLOBAL MARKETS ADVISORY GROUP, NEW YORK: \\u201cI don\\u2019t think it\\u2019s going to have a huge impact on equities, although it may have more of an impact on biotech and healthcare.  \\u201cThis is now an indication that the president\\u2019s agenda is probably going to be more ambitious than Congress can manage. It is probably going to mean that equity markets are going to have to factor in a degree of dysfunction that investors were hoping they wouldn\\u2019t have to. Which means it will likely have a muted impact on equity performance moving forward.  \\u201cThere is very little on the horizon as of right now, as a result of this thing being pulled, that is going to fuel a significant move higher in prices. This is largely going to homogenize any sort of volatility moving forward and is probably going to be a cap on any near-term performance in terms of the upside. \\u201cThe fact this bill, which the President has said flat-out he will make it work for all Americans in general, can\\u2019t pass is an indication this agenda is going to be more ambitious than this Congress can work with. This doesn\\u2019t even include the Democrats.\\u00a0It is not just divided between Democrats and Republicans, it is divided between progressives, Democrats, Republicans and Libertarians. It is an indication that investors should not expect the kind of velocity in terms of agenda accomplishments they were expecting when he was elected.\\u201d MARGARET PATEL, SENIOR PORTFOLIO MANAGER, WELLS FARGO ASSET MANAGEMENT, BOSTON: \\u201cIt looked like the market was worried that the Trump agenda would get completely bogged down in the healthcare issue, and now that they\\u2019ve taken the healthcare issue off the table, I think the market is more optimistic that they can do other things that are more doable that are not so complicated, such as regulatory reform and lowering taxes. It does seem like a positive move to shelve an issue that\\u2019s so complex and very expensive no matter what the plan, move on to something that is a little bit easier, which would be lowering taxes.\\u201d BRIAN BATTLE, DIRECTOR OF TRADING, PERFORMANCE TRUST CAPITAL PARTNERS, CHICAGO: \\u201cIt didn\\u2019t pass and it didn\\u2019t fail so any conjecture about the ultimate meaning is premature. President Trump is getting a lesson in varsity Washington politics.\\u201d STOCKS: S&P 500 pares losses to end session down fractionally; Dow ends down 0.29 percent; Nasdaq ends up 0.19 percent BONDS: 2- and 10-year Treasury yields rise from session lows FOREX: The dollar index edges up by gains against the euro and yen \",\n          \" The \\u2018Fake Melania Trump\\u2019 Conspiracy Theory Is Taking The Internet By Storm And It\\u2019s Everything The Internet is going crazy after photos, videos and .gifs have been circulated of Melania Trump with her husband at a press conference on Monday. Will the real Melania Trump please stand up? Don t look at me like that.

Trump supporters seem upset on Twitter that Melania is trending on the social site over this conspiracy theory, but the ones their president circulated are OK by them. Also, what happened to Melania Trump s nose? There s something funny going on there. And why isn t Alex Jones all over this? Hmm maybe he s a part of it. I mean, if NASA had to step forward to deny that it is running a child sex slave ring on Mars because of Jones s conspiracy theory then we can ask what part he played in switching a body double for the First Lady.

DANIEL MORGAN, SENIOR PORTFOLIO MANAGER, SYNOVUS TRUST COMPANY, ATLANTA, GEORGIA: \\u201cThere\\u2019s a bit of a relief rally. There were worries going into it... but it\\u2019s a mixed bag. \\u201cIt does now open the door for maybe they table the whole thing and just move on, and I would think the next thing on the docket would have to be tax reform. The market, to me, is more interested in tax reform than it is in changing Obamacare. \\u201cIn a way, for me, sitting on $600 million worth of investments, I think it\\u2019s great. Let\\u2019s move and get into tax reform, and then get into the infrastructure bill.\\u201d PETER JANKOVSKIS, CO-CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, OAKBROOK INVESTMENTS LLC, LISLE, ILLINOIS: \\u201cThe market is relieved it\\u2019s not going to go down to a defeat, and it\\u2019s hopeful they\\u2019ll come to some sort of agreement over the weekend. The market is hoping for an agreement as a stepping stone to additional agreements.\\u201d \\u201cNews report suggested that the likely outcome was they were going to lose. I would think the expectations are that they\\u2019re pulling it so they can work on it.\\u201d \\u201cThe last few days, market has sort of traded on the back foot on anticipation of the vote that would happen at some point this week. Generally, risk sentiment has been undermined off of that, especially with this steady drip of news that indicated lacking support for the bill. And now, I think, it sort of lifted that uncertainty, at least temporarily, for the rest of the day. Maybe just lifting the uncertainty premium has markets breathing a sigh of relief for now.\\u201d PARESH UPADHYAYA, DIRECTOR OF CURRENCY STRATEGY, PIONEER INVESTMENTS, BOSTON: \\u201cThe initial market interpretation is a positive sign. It seems like it is taking that Trump wants to instead of sinking it, he wants to give it another shot. It seems like they think he is working to get something on his agenda to be passed by Congress. Or perhaps it\\u2019s a sign that if healthcare reform is shelved, Trump will focus on tax reform. It\\u2019s more a knee jerk reaction.  \\u201cThere are still a lot of hard questions regardless to tax reform. He can\\u2019t force people to change their vote on social media. Good old fashion politicking is needed to build consensus.  \\u201cIf this stronger dollar has legs, it depends on the next step. If there is a pivot to taxes from healthcare, the market has to see the plan.\\u201d RAHUL SHAH, CHIEF EXECUTIVE, IDEAL ASSET MANAGEMENT, NEW YORK: \\u201cFrom an investor viewpoint, it shows that Trump will not be able to easily pass his agenda. That being said, healthcare is more difficult to pass than tax cuts and the infrastructure bill that he\\u2019s proposing. \\u201cIn one sense that\\u2019s a negative, but on the other hand it also might give some relief to investors who are concerned about some of Trump\\u2019s more controversial proposals like increased tariffs and a border adjustment tax.  \\u201cYou could see this as a glass half empty or a glass half-full, gridlock is not something that\\u2019s unheard of on Wall Street, so I think stocks should be OK going forward.\\u201d \\u201cI think the most important thing is that this changes the perception of the relationship between Trump and Congress. For the last few months the assumption has been that Congress would do whatever the Trump plan called for, and that apparently is not going to be the case.\\u201d PETER KENNY, SENIOR MARKET STRATEGIST, GLOBAL MARKETS ADVISORY GROUP, NEW YORK: \\u201cI don\\u2019t think it\\u2019s going to have a huge impact on equities, although it may have more of an impact on biotech and healthcare.  \\u201cThis is now an indication that the president\\u2019s agenda is probably going to be more ambitious than Congress can manage. It is probably going to mean that equity markets are going to have to factor in a degree of dysfunction that investors were hoping they wouldn\\u2019t have to. Which means it will likely have a muted impact on equity performance moving forward.  \\u201cThere is very little on the horizon as of right now, as a result of this thing being pulled, that is going to fuel a significant move higher in prices. This is largely going to homogenize any sort of volatility moving forward and is probably going to be a cap on any near-term performance in terms of the upside. \\u201cThe fact this bill, which the President has said flat-out he will make it work for all Americans in general, can\\u2019t pass is an indication this agenda is going to be more ambitious than this Congress can work with. This doesn\\u2019t even include the Democrats.\\u00a0It is not just divided between Democrats and Republicans, it is divided between progressives, Democrats, Republicans and Libertarians. It is an indication that investors should not expect the kind of velocity in terms of agenda accomplishments they were expecting when he was elected.\\u201d MARGARET PATEL, SENIOR PORTFOLIO MANAGER, WELLS FARGO ASSET MANAGEMENT, BOSTON: \\u201cIt looked like the market was worried that the Trump agenda would get completely bogged down in the healthcare issue, and now that they\\u2019ve taken the healthcare issue off the table, I think the market is more optimistic that they can do other things that are more doable that are not so complicated, such as regulatory reform and lowering taxes. It does seem like a positive move to shelve an issue that\\u2019s so complex and very expensive no matter what the plan, move on to something that is a little bit easier, which would be lowering taxes.\\u201d BRIAN BATTLE, DIRECTOR OF TRADING, PERFORMANCE TRUST CAPITAL PARTNERS, CHICAGO: \\u201cIt didn\\u2019t pass and it didn\\u2019t fail so any conjecture about the ultimate meaning is premature.

The House Oversight and Government Reform Committee wrote Snyder earlier Thursday asking him about published reports that one of his aides, Harvey Hollins, testified in a court hearing last week in Michigan that he had notified Snyder of an outbreak of Legionnairesâ€™ disease linked to the Flint water crisis in December 2015, rather than 2016 as Snyder had testified. â€œMy testimony was truthful and I stand by it,â€ Snyder told the committee in a letter, adding that his office has provided tens of thousands of pages of records to the committee and would continue to cooperate fully.  Last week, prosecutors in Michigan said Dr. Eden Wells, the stateâ€™s chief medical executive who already faced lesser charges, would become the sixth current or former official to face involuntary manslaughter charges in connection with the crisis. The charges stem from more than 80 cases of Legionnairesâ€™ disease and at least 12 deaths that were believed to be linked to the water in Flint after the city switched its source from Lake Huron to the Flint River in April 2014. Wells was among six current and former Michigan and Flint officials charged in June. The other five, including Michigan Health and Human Services Director Nick Lyon, were charged at the time with involuntary manslaughter\",\n",
